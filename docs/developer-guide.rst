Developer Guide
===============

Setup
-----

Install Python ``3.14`` and
`uv 0.9.18 <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/>`_, then run
this command from the repository root:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv sync --locked

This creates ``.venv`` with Locksmith and its development tools. The checked-in
``uv.lock`` fixes the Keripy commit and package versions used by development and
CI. ``--locked`` fails if the lockfile needs an update.

Checks
------

Run the tests, lint, and dependency checks:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv pip check
   uv run --locked ruff check src tests --select E9,F63,F7,F82
   uv run --locked pytest tests/
   uv run --locked pip-audit --local --skip-editable

CI audits dependency changes; the audit workflow can also run manually.
The audit checks published package advisories and skips Locksmith and
Git-sourced Keripy.

Dependency Updates
------------------

To adopt a newer upstream Keripy commit and its required package versions:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv lock --upgrade-package keri
   uv sync --locked

Review the lockfile diff and run the checks before committing it. uv respects
Keripy's exact dependency requirements. Routine installs retain the locked
commit even when upstream moves.

Qt Resource Regeneration
------------------------

The generated Qt resource module lives at ``src/locksmith/resources_rc.py``.

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run --locked python ./scripts/generate_qrc.py
   uv run --locked pyside6-rcc resources.qrc -o resources_rc.py
   mv resources_rc.py ./src/locksmith/

Running Locksmith
-----------------

Once the editable install is in place:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run --locked python -m locksmith.main

Building the Docs
-----------------

Build the local HTML documentation with Sphinx:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv run --locked sphinx-build -W -b html docs docs/_build/html

Plugin Lifecycle
----------------

Locksmith discovers provider integrations from the ``locksmith.plugins``
entry-point group and coordinates their UI, vault lifecycle, background work,
and optional witness hooks.

See :doc:`plugin-authoring` for the complete host contract and a walkthrough of
the bundled KERI Foundation reference implementation.

Credential exchange lifecycle
-----------------------------

Use ``keri.acdc`` for V2 credentials and IPEX. V1 credentials and migration
are out of scope.

The vault owns the registry, wallet inventory, and parser. Submit exchanges
through ``SendIpexDoer``. Call ``locksmith.core.ipexing.admit`` after consent.

A successful send does not mean acceptance. Receiver registry retrieval is not
connected yet; missing evidence prevents acceptance.
